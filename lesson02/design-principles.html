            <p class="description">This website, and more particularly this part of the website, is an excellent example
                of visual
                hierarchy. There are clear places where our eyes go to first, second, and third, and so on. The images
                and text are well sized and it grabs the attention of the user in meaningful ways without detracting
                from the importance of the information provided.</p>

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Google</p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com">Google.com</a>
            <img src="images/google-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Google's main search bar page">
            <p class="description">Google's search bar is a great example of Fitt's law because the target, or the
                search bar, is right in
                front of your face, and the mouse does not have to travel far to get to it. It's pretty obvious that it
                is the most important part to the page, and undoubtedly is one of the easiest and quickest to navigate
                sites to ever exist.</p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Apple</p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a>
            <img src="images/apple-screenshot.png" alt="Apple's website - macbook air page">
            <p class="description">Apple has a ton of whitespace on their site, yet it is entirely visually appealing.
                Similar to how we
                don't fill the entire space of a living room, we don't want to fill an entire web page either. Apple
                does a great job of this, and it gives the site a modern look that definitely grabs the user's
                attention.</p>
