            <h2>Helaman 3:27-28</h2>
            <p>Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon
                his holy name. Yea, thus we see that the agate of heaven is open unto ball, even to those who will
                believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.</p>

            <h2>1 Peter 1:7-9</h2>
            <p>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried
                with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: Whom having
                not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable
                and full of glory: Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>
